# Design to Code Conversion

This project demonstrates my ability to convert a design into a functional webpage using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involves taking design specifications and implementing them in code to create a fully responsive and interactive webpage.

## Features

- **Modal Integration:** Includes a modal that can be triggered by a button click, demonstrating my ability to handle interactive elements using JavaScript.
- **Custom Styling:** Utilizes custom CSS to match the design specifications, including input fields with underline styling and custom checkbox design.
- **No Libraries Used:** The implementation is done using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
